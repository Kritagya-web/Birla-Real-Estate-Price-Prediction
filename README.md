# Dragon-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

# Technology Used:- 
Python,Sklearn,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,RandomForest,Flask,Heroku

      We have dataset of house prices with some features like numbers. of bathrooms, numbers. of bedrooms, etc. Our main task is to create a model which will predict the price of any house by looking at the features .This is RandomForestRegeressor  model selection to solve this problem.


   # Approach:
       Building project specific House price , EDA, under-sampling data, developing a pipeline with sklearn for preprocessing/data wrangling and model building along with cross-validation, model evaluation and  deploying.
